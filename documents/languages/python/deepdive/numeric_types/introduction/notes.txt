So, there are five main types of numeric numbers in the Python language, the integer numbers(int, from Z), the boolean numbers(0 = False, 1 = True), the rational numbers(fraction.Fraction, Q), the real numbers(float, decimal.Decimal, R) and the complex numbers(complex, C). The integers(Z) are a subset of the rational numbers(Q), that are a subset of the real numbers(R), that are a subset of the complex numbers(C).
