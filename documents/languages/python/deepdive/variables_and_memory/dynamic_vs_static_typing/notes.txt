So, with statically typing, you declare a variable with a fixed data type(like in Java: "String myVar = 'hello'") and thus this variable cannot be assigned to another value that isn't a string, because the data type is linked to it. In Python, a dinamically typed language, the variables have no type and therefore can reference values of different data types without anything more than just a reference to a determined object. It is important to note that the memory address is altered in the process. We can use the "type()" function to see the type of the value that is being referenced by the value used as an argument to this function.
