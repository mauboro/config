In this section we are going to talk about memory references, what variables really are, memory management, reference counting vs garbage collection(how they intertwine with each other and what they are), dynamic vs static typing(Python is dinamically typed as opposed to static typed languages such as Java, Swift, and etcetera), mutability and immutability, shared references, variable equality and how, of course, everything in Python is actually and object.
