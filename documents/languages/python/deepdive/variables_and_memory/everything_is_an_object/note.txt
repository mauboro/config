It is important to say that in Python, everything is an object, or, an instance of a class. Functions are objects and therefore ocupy their own memory address that stores their type and their internal state. Since functions are objects, they can be returned by other functions, passed as arguments and even be linked to variables. Any object can be returned by a function, passed as an argument to a function or be stored in a variable. It is important to freeze that referring to a function with parentheses after its name will inevitably invoke it.
