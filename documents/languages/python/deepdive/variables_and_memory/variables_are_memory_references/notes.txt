So, a variable is actually a reference to an address in the computer's memory. When you declare a variable and assign a value to it like "my_var = 10" the computer allocates a place in its memory to store the recently created value 10 and then create an alias (or a pointer) for that place called my_var. You can consult the memory address of a variable by using the "id()" function on it and you can convert the base 10 number that is going to be generated by that function to a hexadecimal number with the "hex()" function.
